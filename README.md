# 🔬 Gamry Data Parser & JSON Converter

This mini project was completed as part of an interview task. The goal was to parse experimental data files generated by the **Gamry** electrochemical instrument and convert them into structured **JSON** files suitable for data analysis, storage, and integration into a larger system.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Modern research labs often generate a large number of experiment files using various instruments. This project envisions a scalable data management pipeline where such raw instrument files are transformed into standardized, structured formats to enable traceability, reproducibility, and efficient data analysis.

In this implementation, we focus on:

- Parsing Gamry data files
- Extracting both shared and experiment-specific metadata
- Converting tabular experiment data into JSON
- Augmenting the data with standardized metadata fields to align with internal design-of-experiments (DOE) structures

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

While this prototype focuses on **Gamry** files, the design is modular and extensible to support other instruments in the future—such as **XRD**, or other electrochemical tools. Each parser is designed as a class, making it easy to extend the logic for additional file types.

## 📊 Metadata Schema

Each JSON output file contains:

| Field              | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `instrument_type` | Currently set to `Gamry` | 
| `experiment_class`| E.g., `EIS`, `Cycling`, etc. |
| `common_metadata` | Metadata shared across Gamry files (e.g., operator, date, comments) |
| `experiment_metadata` | Type-specific metadata |
| `data`            | Main data table, converted into structured list of dictionaries |
| `doe_version`     | Version identifier for the DOE design | (to be implemented)
| `battery_id`      | Unique identifier for the battery or material tested | (to be implemented)
| `doe_section`     | Integer indicating the current step in the DOE protocol | (to be implemented)

> **Note**: `doe_version` refers to a separate table/file (not implemented here), which defines the full DOE plan including section numbers, categorical tags, and comments.

## 📈 Plotting

A simple plotting script is included  to quickly visualize parsed data (e.g., Nyquist plots for EIS). This is intended to validate the correctness of the parsing.
